### Towards More Reproducible Data Wrangling with OpenRefine


Overview
========

OpenRefine (OR) is a popular data wrangling tool. During data cleaning , not only a processed dataset will be generated but also some other provenance-related byproducts. One of them is a native OR recipe (JSON file), and the other one is the Operation History (OH) that lists a series of human-readable data cleaning steps, both of which promote research transparency to some extent by containing some (but incomplete) prospective provenance and partial retrospective provenance information <sup>1</sup>, making them difficult to be directly used for reuse and Reproducibility from OpenRefine Web API (see Fig 1. Data Wrangling in OpenRefine). In this poster, a prototype consisting of two sub-systems, one of which extends the native OR recipe to generate a complete recipe (a.k.a. enhanced receipt)  followed by the second re-runner system, is created to complement the missing information between the actual data cleaning operations and the native OR recipe, which meanwhile facilitates transparency, reproducibility and reusability.

Prototype
=========
The prototype includes two sub-systems. 
Command-Line OpenRefine Prototype for Enhanced Recipe （CLOPER） (see Fig 3.CLOPER}) aims to enhance transparency and reusability of the native OR recipe, which reads in the original "messy" dataset (d1.csv) and communicates with an OR server through the interface provided by the OR-client. The outputs consist of three products: an enhanced recipe (EnhancedRecipe.JSON) is generated at the back-end; a "cleaned" dataet (d2.csv) and a native OR recipe (NativeORRecipe.JSON) are exported from the OR web UI. 

Enhanced Recipe Re-Runner
In regards to reproducibility, ERRR (see Fig 4.ERRR) re-implements the enhanced recipe (EnhancedRecipe.JSON) that is derived from CLOPER, applies to the same original "messy" dataset (d1.csv). Again ERRR connects to an OR server via OR-client and obtains the same output (d2.csv) associated with the native OR recipe (NativeORRecipe.JSON).

Run prototype on your own computer
----------------------------------

To take advantage of all of the sub-systems in the prototype, you need install the software on your computer

### 1. Check installed version of Python

This prototype requires Python version 2.7. To determine the version of Python installed on your computer use the version option to the python command. For example,


     $ python 
      Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 15 2017, 17:16:57) 
      [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.31)] on darwin
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>>
      
Instructions for installing Python may be found at **[Python Download Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.

### 2. Project directory layout

The directories and the descriptions are listed below:
